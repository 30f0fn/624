In addition to this web page, I will put my lectures and other materials in the
directory ~offner/cs624 and subdirectories under it.  Feel free to poke around
there.  Anything there (or under there) is for you to take.  (Note that these
are not web pages&mdash;they are ordinary files, and you have to log in to your
cs.umb.edu account to access them.)

<!--   <p>Due to a family emergency, I will be out of town on Monday, February 3, so -->
<!--   we will not have class then.  The homework that was due then is now due on -->
<!--   Wednesday, and we will discuss on Wednesday how to make up the missed -->
<!--   time.</p> -->

<!--   <p>If you want to start reading ahead, we will be covering Chapter 6 on -->
<!--   Wednesday.  My notes for that are in the usual place: -->

<!--         <li><p>Wednesday: We start depth-first search.  This corresponds to -->

<b>Prerequisite:</b>
<ul>
  <li>CS 220 or CS 320L or MATH 320L (these are all the same course):  Applied
  Discrete Mathematics
</ul>
<p/>

<p>This prerequisite is important.  You really need to have taken this course,
and done well in it, or can convince me you really do know this material, to get
the benefit of CS 624.</p>

<p> Further, while this is the official prerequisite, there is some other
material that you really need to know in order to understand what we are doing
in this course.  I do know that you have studied this before, but I just want to
make it explicit here.  I will not review this material in class&mdash;you are
responsible for understanding it.  The homework and also the exams will include
problems using this material:

<ul>
  <li>

  <p><b>Some serious single-variable calculus:</b> derivatives, the chain
  rule, integrals, the "Fundamental Theorem of the Calculus", maxima and
  minima, increasing and decreasing functions.  You should be able to take the
  derivative of expressions like this one:
  <code>(5x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 4)<sup>88</sup></code></p>
  <p>And of course you should never get confused between the two
  functions
  <ul>
    <li><code>f(x) = x<sup>a</sup></code> (for instance, <code>f(x) =
    x<sup>3</sup></code>) and</li>
    <li><code>g(x) = a<sup>x</sup></code> (for instance, <code>g(x) =
    3<sup>x</sup></code>)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>Which one grows faster?  And is the difference in growth significant?
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><b>High school algebra.  Please refresh yourself on these topics.  It's
  not really much, and I'm sure you have seen all this before.  Let me know if
  you're not sure what I mean.:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you know the formula for the sum of a geometric series?  Can you
    derive it? (It's really very simple.  I'm sure you saw it in high
    school. And it's very neat.)</li>
    <li>Can you add algebraic fractions?  I'm talking about expressions like
    this:
    <code>(x + 1)/(x - 3) + (x - 4)/(x<sup>2</sup> + 11)</code></li>
    <li>Can you manipulate and simplify expressions involving square roots?</li>
    <li>Do you know the quadratic formula?
  </ul>

  <li><b>Some basic probability theory:</b>  I don't really expect much, but I
  imagine you will have had an introduction to some simple probability theory.
  Our text does cover what you need, and in fact covers much more than you need.</li>

  <!-- <li><b>Some basic probability theory:</b> combinatorics applied to -->
  <!-- probability; expectation; conditional probability; independence.  Appendices -->
  <!-- C.1-C.4 of the text go over this material&mdash;more than we will really need, -->
  <!-- but you should at least look it over and you should be familiar with a fair -->
  <!-- amount of it.  You should be able to do at least some of the exercises there -->
  <!-- yourself.  If you have questions about them, send me email, and I'll be glad -->
  <!-- to help.  But I'm not going to cover this material in class&mdash;you are -->
  <!-- responsible for it.</li> -->

</ul>

<p>I don't mean this to be intimidating.  Many people get very frightened by
even elementary mathematics.  There is no need to be frightened.  And I'll
always be available to help you out.</p>

<b>Text:</b>
<p/>
<p>Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition<br>
by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein<br>
MIT Press, 2009</p>

<p>This is the most widely used text (by far) in this kind of course, all over
this country, and maybe all over the world.  It's a great book; it's very well
written; it covers a vast number of important topics; and you can keep it and
refer to it throughout your career.</p>


<p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<hr>
<b>Syllabus:
</b>

<p>I'm sure everyone in this class has taken one or more courses in which you
have learned some of the really great algorithms.</p

<p>This is not one of those courses.  This is not a course in "really great
algorithms", or in writing programs, or even in writing pseudo-code.</p>

<p>This is for all practical purposes a mathematics course.  It is a course on
the <b>analysis</b> of algorithms.  We are going to prove theorems in this
course.  In fact, that's just about all we are going to do.  And when I say
<em>we</em>, I really mean <em>you</em>.  The homework will consist of theorems
that you will have to prove.  The exams will consist of theorems that you will
will have to prove.  That's what we're going to do.</p>

<p>
At a minimum, I plan to cover the following material this term:
</p>
<ol>

  <li> Introductory material.  What do we mean by analysis of algorithms?  Why do
  we care?  Some basic examples.</li>

  <li> Mathematical background and some useful mathematical techniques.  Orders
  of growth of functions.  Solving and estimating solutions of recursions.
  Generating functions.</li>

  <li> The analysis of Heapsort and Quicksort.  Best-case, worst-case, and

<p/>
There are many other topics that I'd really like to cover as well.  This is just
a fascinating field.  We'll see&hellip;

<br>
<hr>
<b>Course Work:</b>

<p> There will be one homework assignment each week.  I will not accept
assignments handed in late.</p>

<p> There will be two in-class "mid-term" exams, and one final exam.  </p>

<p> All the exams will be "closed-book" exams.  No books, no notes, no
smartphones or other electronic equipment, and so on.  Just bring something to
write with.</p>

<hr>

<b> Grading:</b>

<p> I will weight the work in the course roughly as follows when making up final
grades:</p>

<ul>

  <li> All the homeworks, taken together:  20%</li>

  <li> Both mid-term exams, taken together: 40%</li>

  <li> Final exam: 40%</li>

</ul>

<p> I will not give out "review sheets" for the exams.  It
should go without saying, however, that the very best way to prepare for the
exams is to

<ul>
  <li> do the homework, and </li>

  <li> read the handouts carefully.  If there is anything you don't understand
  in them, you need to ask me about it.  And the earlier you ask, the
  better.</li>

</ul>

<b>Writing Proofs:</b>

<p> This course does not involve any programming per se,
although without a doubt your experiences in building serious programs will help
you understand many of the issues we deal with.</p>

<p>In fact, as I already stated above, the course could well be regarded as a
mathematics course.  I will be proving things in class, and you will be expected
to write formal proofs in your assignments and on exams.  If this is something
you are not ready to come to grips with, you should wait until you are ready to
take this class.  That doesn't mean, though, that I expect you to be experts in
proving things.  Constructing proofs is a very sophisticated skill that we will
work on all term.  You will gradually get better at it.  And I'll be very
willing to help you every way I can.</p>

<p>There is a style to writing proofs.  In fact, there are several styles.  But
the main thing to keep in mind when writing a proof is this: Your goal should be
to write a proof that is easy to read and that illuminates the reason why
something is true.  That's really what a proof is.  And this is not easy to do.
Good writing of any kind is difficult, and we will work hard at it all term.
</p>

<p>Probably the single most important proof technique in this area is
mathematical induction.  I will assume that you have had some experience with
this technique, and I'll give you some pointers, since we will be using it a
lot.</p>

<p>I also expect you to be familiar with standard mathematical notations such as
summations (and of course, integrals).  Some of this is reviewed in the
appendices of the text.  I will not review this in class.  I expect you to know
it, and we will be using it a lot.</p>

<p>One thing is very important to bear in mind: Like any other kind of writing,
a proof <b>must</b> be understandable.  If I can't understand what you are
writing, then it can't be correct.  And I'm not going to try to guess what you
had in mind.</p>

<p>(One thing I have noticed is that some students seem to believe there is only
one way to do something, and only one way to explain it, and so of course I must
understand what they mean.  But that's not true.  There are almost always many
ways to do things, and many ways to explain them.  If I write on your paper "I
don't understand this", I'm not being irritable&mdash;I really <b>don't</b>
understand it.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain how to express something, please just talk
to me or send me email, and I'll try hard to help you.  But don't even bother
writing something that can't be understood.</p>

<p>Think of this like you would when writing a computer program.  If the compiler
or interpreter can't understand it, it's wrong.  And you have to be really
careful with your use of language and terms.  For instance, one thing beginning
programmers often get mixed up about is the correct use of "or" and "and".  The
meaning in computer languages is not the same as in English (or any other
natural language, so far as I know).  The same is true in proofs.  We use
language in very precise and fixed ways in proofs, and we do this so that what
we write can be understood in its exact meaning by anyone at any time, anywhere
in the world.</p>

<p>
Just for a simple example:  the sentence "All horses are not white." does
<b>not</b> mean the same as "Not all horses are white."  At least, not when
writing proofs.  In ordinary English, these two sentences are generally regarded
as equivalent.  But for our purposes they are not.  You have to be careful about
this.</p>

<p>Here's another example:  The symbol "==>" means "implies".  It does <b>not</b>
mean "then".  So you can write
<pre>
   if x = 3 then x + 5 = 8
</pre>
or you can write
<pre>
   x = 3 ==> x + 5 = 8
</pre>
But you <b>cannot</b> write
<pre>
   if x = 3 ==> x + 5 = 8   <font color=red>!!! WRONG !!!</font>
</pre>

Here's another thing to watch out for:  the symbol "=" means "equals".  It
doesn't mean anything else.  (Well, there is one small exception, involving
"big-O" notation, which we will cover in the second class.)  So you could
write something like this:

<pre>
    2x - 1 = 5
  <font color=red>so</font>
         x = 3
</pre>
But you <b>cannot</b> write
<pre>
    2x - 1 = 5
   <font color = red>=</font>     x = 3       <font color = red>!!! WRONG !!!</font>
</pre>

Please try to be careful about things like this.  And please don't be offended
if I correct mistakes like this in what you write.</p>

<b>Collaborating with Others</b>

<p> I encourage you to talk with other students&mdash;in fact, with
anyone&mdash;about the topics we are covering.  And I also encourage you to send
me email with questions; I'll be happy to get back to you as quickly as I can.
Asking me questions, and sending me email does not lower your grade.  And it
does not make me think badly of you.  In fact, it shows me that your are taking
this material seriously.  This material we will be studying is very
sophisticated.  <em>Of course</em> you will have questions.  That's good.</p>

<p>However, the writeups you hand in must be entirely your own.  You may not
copy proofs, or algorithms, or parts of proofs or algorithms, or anything else,
from anyone else's paper, or from the web, or from books, or from anywhere else,
<b>even if you give credit to that person or source.</b> And you must be able to
explain to me what you have written.</p>

<p>I also expect you to read the file ~offner/cs624/honesty.pdf.  This file
spells out in more detail exactly we should look at our work in this course.</p>

<p>Please do take this seriously.  I'm very happy to try to help you out in
person or by email.  I really do want every one of you to succeed, and I'll try
hard to make that happen.  But I have no tolerance at all for plagiarism.  If I
find evidence of it, you will receive an F for the course.  And I don't give
"second chances".</p>

<b> On-line resources:</b>
<p/>
Two web sites that you might profitably look at are:
<p/>
<ul>

  <li> The course as it was taught at MIT in 2011: <a

  <p/>

  <li> The course as it has been taught at Stony Brook by Steven Skiena: <a
   href="http://www.algorist.com"> http://www.algorist.com</a>.  Skiena is the
   author of another text&mdash;<em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em>&mdash;that
   is just full of wonderful and insightful case studies and "war stories" about
   the design and practical application of algorithms.  It is well worth
   reading, and in the past has been used as an auxiliary text in this class.  I
   didn't want to make it a required text, but you won't be wasting either your
   time or your money by getting it.

</ul>

On both these web sites you can find lecture notes and videos of course
lectures.
